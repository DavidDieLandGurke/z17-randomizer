ok it turns out at one point in develpoment
they were loading model.bch files right from World/Actor

the folder doesnt exsist in the vanilla game
but the coding to load models from there is still active
as long as the filename is correct the game will load the .bch from there instead of looking in the areas .szs archive

assuming that there is no drawbacks
this could cut down on a lot of copy and pasting models and file size inflation

all you need to do is go into a .szs archive
take and extract a actors .bch file
name it accourdingly (more on names later)
then put it in World/Actor/[name].bch
then you can call the actor with its model from any area



-----names-----
finding names is easy for the most part
usually the name of the mesh is the same name as the file name
but if it isnt then you may need to dig through the code.bin to find it
